## Acknowledgement

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Celebal technologies for providing us with the opportunity to explore practical applications of JavaScript in Week 7. This assignment helped me strengthen my understanding of string manipulation, array methods, and core programming logic.

I also thank the CSI team for their continuous support, guidance, and engaging curriculum that encourages hands-on learning and real-world problem solving.
